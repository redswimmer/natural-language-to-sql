# Natural Language to SQL Demo

This example demonstrates how to query our SQL database using natural language by leveraging the LLM OpenAI and [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/).  It was adapted from [this example by Jerry Liu](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/index_structs/struct_indices/SQLIndexDemo.html) to add support for multiple tables and foreign keys.

## Demo Video

I recorded a [demo video here](https://www.loom.com/share/1aa2b1f582784127bcb49f432c867818?sid=bdf2e506-0be2-4a6e-87e3-37ef6d6435d4) if you don't feel like reading the code.

## Requirements

You'll need an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and to install LlamaIndex `pip install llama-index`
